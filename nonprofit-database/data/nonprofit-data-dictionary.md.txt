## Data Quality Issues Identified

- **Empty rows:** 24 completely empty entries removed during cleaning
- **Invalid miles data:** String values found in numeric miles column
- **Inconsistent volunteer areas:** Multiple variations of same area names
- **Date format variations:** Mixed date formats requiring standardization
- **Whitespace:** Leading/trailing spaces in text fields
- **Duplicate volunteers:** Potential same person with different name spellings

## Monthly Reporting Requirements

The database must support aggregation queries for:
1. **Total miles** by month across all volunteers
2. **Total volunteer hours** by volunteer area and month
3. **Unique volunteer count** by month
4. **Session count** by volunteer area and month

## Data Retention

- **Volunteer session records:** Retain for 5 years for reporting purposes
- **Personal volunteer information:** Remove upon volunteer request
- **Aggregated monthly data:** Retain permanently for historical analysis

## Access Control Levels

- **Admin:** Full CRUD access to all tables
- **Data Entry:** INSERT/UPDATE access to volunteer_sessions
- **Viewer:** SELECT access for reporting queries only
- **Public:** No access to individual volunteer data

## Compliance Considerations

- Volunteer personal information treated as confidential
- Comments may contain sensitive details requiring careful handling
- Data export for portfolio uses anonymized/fake names only
